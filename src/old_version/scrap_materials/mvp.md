    conceal: as long as it doesnt move becomes invisible, cant be trigered while in enemy sight if your patrol contain
    scouts.
    set Trap: cause damage a enemy unit that enters that tile and stop their move
    hit&run: if an enemy formation is within
    movement range you can activate, defender choose deployment zone and deploys first, you are the attacker, you place
    your army 18" from enemy units, you have first turn. attacker gets to end the game in any of his command phasesafter
    the first.
    deepstrike (in battle action): if the player owns deepstrike center, you can choose to send this formation to any
    battle as reinforcement (teleport in) from turn 2 onwards.
    outflank: if the formation is within range of another friendly formation engaged it can arrive outflanking from turn
    2 onwards
    flatout: move 6 squares in straight line until possible, need to rest a full turn after, if finds a enemy formation
    does a hit and run action
